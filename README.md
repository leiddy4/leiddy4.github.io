wave to earth (웨이브투어스) currently consists of 3 members: Daniel Kim, Soonjong Cha, and Dong Q. Even though they’re a Korean band, most of their songs are written in English. Originally the band consisted of Shin Donggyu and Daniel, debuting with their single ‘Wave‘ in August 2019. In January of 2020, Wave To Earth released their first EP [Wave 0.01] with their new member Soonjong Cha. They’re currently under We Are Not 0, POCLANOS. While the three of them are the official members, the session members also include Jo Jung-geun (keyboard), Jeon-min (saxophone) and Hong Seung-gi, an artwork member. In November 21 of 2021, it was announced that they were under Wavy. The name Wave to Earth reveals the band’s desire to “become the new wave” and expand its own universe across the world.
